# In2-PI-Swift

Please note that downloading this repo alone will not make this project work in Xcode.
- Admin password was hidden from public repo. It's stored in our team folder in Google Drive in a .swift file under Dev Resources
- Also do note that due to sudden change in project name from In2 PI to Win2, there were a lot of errors after changing xcode project name and accomodating Cocoapods as well. Be very careful running "pod install" or "pod update" because workspace settings are slightly unstable. 
- Launch In2-PI workspace file from Xcode to launch simulator
