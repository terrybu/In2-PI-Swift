To-Do List as of 1/11/2016

1) Communications vc + Social Services VC ... need apply cards
- Social Services: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1iVa3r1dZ4GTe4FzSBTHFUV4dfY4MyVIYGEN-MkXOF_g/viewform?ts=5614a6c8&edit_requested=true

- Communications:
2.6.2016
= Massive problems trying to insert a UI into interface builder for Communications view controller screen
= the "Long apply widget view" would spill out its contents over the about bar for some crazy reason
    - Gonna remove it for now. If it ever becomes a problem, need some surgery in there. Might take some time figuring out exactly what was going wrong with Auto layout between About Expanding View and the Long Apply Widget View

2) last big piece is 긍휼부 칼렌더 and Admin post mode. Firebase may be used to post "strings" up there for"
    3-4 hours

3) Home screen needs to finalized with whatever cards you want to put in there
    - Add "News" widget in there?
    1-2 hours

4) Sign up page looks weird on actual phone. Keep testing on actual device
Invalid Login Alert looks weird at Login. Fix.

5) Parse code needs to be replaced with Firebase in Login/Signup code
1-2 hours ... Isn't this low priority? I can also migrate later.

***MiscGallery page is pulling from 3 recently updated albums, one of which is 한줄나눔 which uses a lot of same images and very uninteresting. Skip it?
    1 hour

====================
Expected time needed
7 ~ 10 hours
